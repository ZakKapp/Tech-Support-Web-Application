# Tech-Support-Web-Application
Building off of a pre-designed tech support web application where new pages needed to be added.
The goal of this project is practice the use of PHP and SQL to create a web application. The project was part of a web development class at Central Washington University.
I was provided a skeleton of the tech support application and needed to add various new features and pages to the application throughout the class. The version uploaded
here is the final version that I had completed by the end of the class. The instructions for the project can be found in the Projects.pdf file. This version of the 
tech support application goes up to Project 12-1 in the document.
